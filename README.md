# physics-nbody
a simple nbody simulator for gravitation(newtons).
## controls
1. wasd - movement
2. scrool - zoom
3. left click - add particle
## note
you could change the value of G to k to make it for electron fields but its never tested.
also i ~~forgot~~ didnt allow each particle to have their own mass(optimization)(pygame is too slow(maybe c++ in future?)).
