# physics-nbody
a simple nbody simulator for gravitation(newtons).
## controls
1. wasd - movement
2. scrool - zoom
3. left click - add particle
## note
you can also run the python version but it will be very slow(400 particles max on my intel celeron). the cpp one could handle to around 4000 particles on my celeron cpu.
i might optimize it even more in future.
